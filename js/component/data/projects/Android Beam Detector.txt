<h4 style="text-align: center;">Android and JAVA Beam Statistics Engine</h4>
<p>For years, both hardware and software engineers have struggled with the
acquisition of device information in a flexible and fast perspective, numerous
devices cannot have their status quickly tested due to time limitation associated
with the travelling to a computer terminal. For instance, in order to test a
scintillator status, one has to inject beam into the device and quickly return to a
terminal to see the results, this is not only time demanding but extremely
inconvenient for the person responsible, it consumes time that would be used in
more pressing matters. In this train of thoughts, the proposal of creating an
interface to bring a stable, flexible, user friendly and data driven solution to this
problem was created. Being the most common operative system for mobile
display, the Android API proved to have the best efficient in financing, since it is
based on an open source software, and in implementation difficulty since itâ€™s
backend development resides in JAVA calls and XML for visual representation.</p></div>

The main goal of this project was to make a fully customizable GUI in the
Android system so that each user could create his own interface with the list of
devices to watch, server and crates to filter, which mode of datamap generation
(ex.: Acquisition, EaPiquet), which fields to represent from the datamap file and
how they should be represented (ex.: profiled, displayed on one line, formatted
scalar, formatted date, etc.).
